            <p>Hi..I'm Irina Maltseva, You are must Welcome to My website visit. I started About Myself. I had never been
                to a
                competition so this was something totally out of my comfort
                zone! I didn't receive any help, just trained on my own, did my own nutrition having absolutely no idea
                what I was doing.However ,I got up on athat stage and felt so proud of myself.After the competition I
                struggled badly. I ate evrything in sight, was depressed, wouldn't go to the gym, got fat. It look me
                nine months to get that sorted and under control.</p>

                our "Bests." Try them, and we bet you'll agree.</p>
